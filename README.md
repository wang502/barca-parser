# barca-parser

This is an HTML parser for C++. It parses HTML files into C++ objects. It is implemented according to the [HTML parsing algorithm.](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/#auto-toc-12).

The reason I name it as barca-parser is because I am a big fan of [FC Barcelona.](www.fcbarcelona.com/)

### Testing
test the parser:

    make testparser
    ./main

test the Dom object:

    make testdom
    ./main
